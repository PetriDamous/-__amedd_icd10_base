00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909
Hello and welcome to the icd-10
 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
concussion coding course I'm Leslie
 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
Walker and I will be your guide during
 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
this course as we just saw in the
 
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
opening film clip there is the potential
 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
for servicemembers to sustain
 
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
concussions in a variety of activities
 
00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
whether deployed in training during a
 
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
stateside assignment or off-duty early
 
00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
in my career as a military medical
 
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
provider I evaluated and treated many
 
00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
service members for concussion in doing
 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
so I recognized the importance of coding
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
those visits correctly to ensure service
 
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
members received the appropriate level
 
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
of care no matter where they were in the
 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
continuum of care I owed it to the
 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
service members and all the medical

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
providers who would review my records to
 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
take the time to code my encounters
 
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
thoroughly and accurately as my career
 
00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
progressed so did my interest in the
 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
correct treatment and management of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
concussion and now I'm focused on policy
 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
and training in this role it's even
 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
clearer to me how crucial accurate
 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729
records are in funding auditing
 
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
identifying trends and areas for
 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
improvement for coordinating care among
 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
providers and most importantly improving
 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
patient outcomes
 
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
this training is specific to diagnosis
 
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
coding for concussion evaluation and
 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
management coding and procedure coding
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
are beyond the scope of this training so
 
00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
let's take a look at what we'll be
